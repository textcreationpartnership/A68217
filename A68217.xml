            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, ſuch ſpillings are but ſtrange fire, as all els are which in worſhipping hee commandeth not, and ſuch fire the Lord will deuoure with fire from heauen, as he did <hi>Nahab</hi> and <hi>Abihn,</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron.

He would not obey, as he was commanded, but as hee liſted: therefore, the Lord had no pleaſure in him, nor in any of his offerings. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15 22. Thirdly, God is pleaſed when we do his will, and obey his word. And obedience, in this ſenſe, is as the ſalt of the offering, that keepes it in good taſte; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it ſtincks before God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. as before. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.22.23. and is God pleaſed when his word is obeyed? then, it muſt needs vexe him, when it is not.

They had (as moſt of our ignorants now haue) a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced conſcience in vaine things, but no conſcience of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in Spirit and truth. Such worſhippers were the Samaritans: they ſtood vpon the formalitie of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, when there was no water in it, ſuch as <hi>Iacob</hi> drank of, when hee drank of the Spirit. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.12. So nature and cuſtome taught them their religion: and haue the moſt of our people any other teachers at this day?

This is not to doe after the doctrine here, but contrarily; and will Chriſt tarie, where hee hath but an outſide, and not the inwards of a true welcom in the Goſpel? One ſaith well: he that is maried to a fleſhly religion, or religion of no Spirit, cannot haue Chriſt for his Husband.

               <p>THis is the reaſon why Chriſt could not bee hid. Hee was ſo followed by the weaker ſexe, a Woman, and (which is ſtranger) a ſtranger, a Cananite, that hee could not, where, wee may note the importunitie and boldnes of Faith: that grace, which is the victorie ouer all denials; and that which will haue no nay. For, this Woman, hauing ſought Chriſt by heareſay, and by her Faith found him, and bound him in a ſort, to diſpoſſeſſe her vexed young daughter, ſhe reſts not till it be done. And ſo in theſe words and in thoſe that follow here, &amp; in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> we haue the other occaſions of the conference fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that, in the Woman, was her ſtrong Faith, which is here
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17238:25"/>gathered: and, out of her, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions were; her daughters vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Deuill, and the report that went of Chriſt both of them ſet downe in this verſe, ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent circumſtances there are; asthe deſcription of the woman by her ſexe, and countrie in the next verſe. And her manner of importuning Chriſt, here and in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> the manner this: it was with a crying tongue, ſhee cryed vnto him: <hi>Math.</hi> 15.22. &amp; with a low geſture downe to the ground, ſhe fell downe at his feet. <hi>Marc.</hi> 7.25. But of theſe, when wee come vnto them in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts owne order. Meane while we wil conſider, who came to Chriſt, and why. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that came to Chriſt; it is ſaid here, that a certain Woman came vnto him. The word (as wee heard) had loſt edge among his own people, and (here) he whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it among the Gentils. In Iewrie, where God was knowne,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17238:26"/>Chriſt could finde but few that would receiue the grace which he offered: here, in a land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and among the curſed Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, a Woman and Cananite, doth in a manner, euen compell him to giue the grace which hee offered not. And here, a Woman is oppoſed to Men: a Cananite to men in Iſrael: a curſed ſtock to a holy ſeed: a whelp of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Sonnes: no Scholar to great Diuines: one of no learning to learned men: and where none of the Phariſes wold follow Chriſt, ſhe, a ſimple Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, could not bee driuen from him. Thus, the word that had turned edge in Iudea, got a ſharp edge here, being whetted vpon a Cananite, which could not but be a ſhame to the whole land of Iewry, to the Doctors, and all the Rabbies there:
<note place="margin">

This is another occaſion (as it were legge) of the Womans comming to Chriſt, and (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) an impelling occaſion of the conference had with him, and this made her to come rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and running to him. Here, a ſharp aſſault was made vpon her Faith: who, being but lately (it would ſeeme) conuerted from Paganiſme to religion, had ſo ill a welcome to God, as to haue a Deuill throwne into her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet the ſhield of Faith in her right hand warded off the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and ſhe neither laid blame vpon the holy Faith, vnto which ſhe was conuerted, nor repented of the change, followed with ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17238:30"/>grieuous an affliction. Many would (in ſuch a caſe) haue thought they had made but a bad change of their old religion, thus to bee welcomed by the Deuill, in a new: but her Faith (which was an occaſion, in her, of this conference) would not permit her ſo to miſtake; rather it driues her to the throne of mercie, with an implicit confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her little worth in any thing: for <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22 with the voice of a crying ſupplication, ſhe ſaid: haue mercy vpon Mee, O Lord. Surely it was no light affliction, and it could not but be ſtrange newes to a woman, and that woman a Cananite, to haue a kinde of hell in her houſe, or a deuil at home in a daughter ſo deare vnto her. For, what might ſhe think, but that God had caſt her off, who thus had caſt the Deuill into her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? yet ſhee bore all quietly (as we heard) and, in her faith (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17238:30"/>with hope,) went bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſt for helpe.

So the Prophet in trouble gaue not ouer, but took ſurer hold, faſtning vpon God for deliuerance, to whom he directed the eye of his ſoule. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1.2. at another time, in ſome great trouble of minde, and queſtion of life, hee commended into the hand of his ſupreme Lord, the ſpirit, which God had redeemed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. and ſo, went not from God in that croſſe but, by its approach, drew nearer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

Thoſe witneſſes (alſo) of Chriſt, ſpoken of by the Author to the Hebrewes (of whom wee haue a large Role in the 11. Chapter of that Epiſtle) were (all of them) faithfull men and women; and therefore, hauing pitched vpon Chriſt, no terrors of deathcould take them off. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.35.36.37.38. ſo certain it is that no croſſe of troubles can beate the faithfull from Chriſt.

                  <p>THE further occaſion of this conference was the ſame that went of Chriſt, which this woman receiued, not as matter of talke, or of ordinarie newes, but as a word of Goſpell, or glad tidings, reflecting vpon her ſelfe, and her miſerable young daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore, ſhe heard with faith, came in haſte, &amp; fell downe reuerently at Chriſts feet. For the firſt, which is her hearing of him; as it ſheweth that, in Gods diſpenſation, there are fit meanes for the drawing of his elect vnto him, and that hearing is one: ſo it ſheweth (alſo) that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gaue her ſelfe into the hand of the meanes, for her comming to Chriſt: for, hauing heard; ſhe came without delay, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. The ready way to Chriſt is to heare of him with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17238:41"/>in his ſaluation, and this way the woman took vnto him, hauing heard of him by the word of fame. For, ſhee had a ſurer word then this, in the winde of heauen that blew within, that is, ſhe heard outwardly (as many els did, who were neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;) and ſhe heard inwardly, as fewels did; and who (then) with ſuch a Faith? ſhe had a taſte of the general promiſes of the word, and the ſpirit taught her the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; but by both meanes ſhe was brought to Chriſt. The meanes (here ſpoken of) is the report which ſhee heard, and ſo we ſee, that hearing is our rode to Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> this woman (firſt) heard of Chriſt, and (then) came vnto him, and Chriſt himſelfe, where he ſpeaks of comming to him, ſaith: hee that commeth to me, and heareth my words; that is, he that, by way of hearing, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. <hi>Luc.</hi> 6.47. hearing (then) is the way; ſo, after that a certain
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17238:42"/>woman had ſaid to Chriſt; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the wombe that bare thee, he anſwered, ſaying; rather bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that heare the word of God &amp; keep it. <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.27 28. where hearing goes before kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, &amp; they that wold keep, muſt heare. But doth Chriſt denie that his Mother was bleſſed for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him of her bodie? I anſwer, he doth not: for, the word rather doth not implie an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, but a compariſon betweene leſſe and more, as if he had ſaid, I doe not ſay that ſhe is not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for bearing me on her bodie but I ſay, that ſhe was more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo are they that beare mee in the wombe of faith by good hearing: further, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour proueth ſome Iewes not to be of God, by this reaſon, that they will not heare Gods word: for he ſaith, they that are of God, heare Gods Word: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that they are not of God, that heare it not, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.47.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17238:42"/>A like argument is made by a fauourite of his, Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.6. and <hi>Salomon</hi> requireth in the houſe of God, and in thoſe that come vnto it, a readineſſe to heare, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.17.

Some with <hi>Ieroboam</hi> thinke (whatſoeuer they ſay) that it is too farre to go to Ieruſalem, or too much to come to Church, morning and after-noone: and therefore, (with that guide to idolatrie) make calues at home, of wanton impediments from Gods houſe: but, O that they conſidered in heart, that whiles they thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the worlds way to vanitie, not the Church way to God, they are in a broad way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, not in any way to Chriſt, and that God and they cannot meet in two ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wayes: then they would bee where they might bee ſure to meet him in the aſſemblie,

Wee will not ſpeake to a great man, and our hats on; how dare we (then) be couered, ſpeaking in prayer to the great God, if we had him in any reuerence, the knees would doe reuerence that come before him: therefore, of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> it is written, that his knees became hard as a Camels hoofe, with often and long kneeling in prayer: but it may be written of ſome in the booke of their ſhame, that their tender knees cannot endure to touch the hard ground, when they ſhould bow downe to pray: if they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the head, that's all: they

But the humbler the heart is, the lower will the bodie goe in prayer: therefore, (in ſigne of humilitie) children aske bleſſing vpon their knees: we are not worthie to gather vp thoſe crummes of grace that fall from our Lords table: and are wee too good to aske them on our knees, and bare headed? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, God requireth the heart: the knee doth litle ſeruice, and the hat off, as litle reuerence: yet as out of the abundance of the

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3</note> teaching how much Chriſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe; and that therefore we ſhould learne of him to bee meek and lowly in heart. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. to be meek and lowly in heart is the perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who, the lower hee layes his foundation, the ſurer will his houſe ſtand, and to be ſo, the way is, to take a ſight of our ſelues in good and heauenly things. For, then, in vs, wee ſhall finde that, which will humble vs farre below that which (we thinke) wee are, meaſured by carnall reaſon, if we feare, that is, ſuſpect all we do, or the beſt we can doe, we ſhall not be high minded: ſo the Apoſtle tells vs, when hee biddes vs, not to be high minded, but to feare. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. Chriſt emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17238:74"/>for our filling, and humbled himſelfe for our example. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8. We haue nothing to let out but wind: and, if we could ſee our ſelues in true account, wee are low enough. But (like purblinde Laodiceans). we can ſee nothing but fulneſſe, where is nothing but indigence, and want. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.17. either wee ſtand vpon the clay feet of gentrie: and (then) who ſhall go before vs? or vpon termes of ſelf-ſufficiencie (like Phariſies) and (then) wee haue neede of nothing. But ſo long as we are ſo minded; we will neuer be followers of Chriſt in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of humilitie: therefore, as Chriſt was abaſed for vs: ſo (if we will bee filled with Chriſt) wee muſt emptie our ſelues of all high conceit of our ſelues, that his Spirit may fill vs. And, for theſe fillings with wind: we muſt prick the bladder, that they may goe out. More diſtinctly and plainely; we muſt purge out ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17238:74"/>and ſelf-liking, and bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his ſake, who, for ours, made himſelfe nothing. If wee will be proud: let vs (as one ſaith well) be proud againſt Satan for Chriſt; but humble to all men, in Chriſt. In giuing honour, let vs go before others: but before none in taking it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. Finally (as the Apoſtle ſaith) let vs be of like affection, one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not minde high things, and let vs condiſcend to men of lower eſtate, and not bee wiſe in our owne conceits. <hi>v.</hi> 16. ſo ſhall we walke in the ſteps of Chriſts humilitie; who, being ſo high in glorie, laid away his glorie; and (of the Sonne of God) became the Sonne of Man, a worme and no man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.</p>
                  <p>Further, Chriſt was not only the Son of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the naturall line, but in the regall, the next to the crowne of <hi>Iudah,</hi> after his Mother, and ſuppoſed Father, <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17238:75"/>Chriſt Man, was (of all men) the nobleſt Man. For, one way, hee was the Sonne of God: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of kingly ranke among the Sonnes of Men.

For, ſo it was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them by the tongue of heauen in a ſtrong ſtarre; and it ſeemes that <hi>Hered</hi> had heard as much. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.3. Indeed at the time of his birth, the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety of it was gone, and the Sunne of it downe, and ſo Chriſt was a titular, not real King. The Scepter was now in a Roman hand: the Emperours there, were Kings of Iurie: and Chriſt (as was prophecied by <hi>Eſay</hi>) but a bud out of a dead ſtock. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.2.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17238:75"/>Yet had hee an euer-during throne, better then all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.6.8. &amp; ſo, was, euery way, (of al men) the nobleſt Man; The ſtarre, (which the wiſemen followed) ſhewed it: <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Herod,</hi> (<hi>Caſars</hi> vnder-King) feared it, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Chriſt conteſſed it. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.37. the Iewes (queſtioned by <hi>Pilate</hi>) could not ſpeake againſt it, though ſaying nothing for it.

                     </note> the reaſon why Chriſt ſhold be thus, euery way noble; may be taken from the good pleaſure of God, and fitnes to him.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17238:104"/>Womans humble requeſt two things: as, the perſon to whom ſhe makes it, and the thing for what. The Perſon is Chriſt the Lord: but why not to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? and why not to him by them? the reaſon was: her faith, being a true faith, ſet her a better and a neerer way: and that was directly to Chriſt, and not about to, or by the creature. The Lords prayer (the text &amp; mother of all true prayer) directs to none but to our Father in heauen. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17238:113"/>asked, but onely puts her to her attendance for it: where wee learne,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1</note> that Chriſt doth not trample vpon thoſe that are downe, but rather reacheth them his hand to riſe by: hee will not take the weake Chriſtian at the worſt, but tells him how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, when through anguiſh of Spirit, his ſoule is in perplexity. Hereupon <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, that the Lord will not contend for euer, or be alwaie chiding, <hi>Eſa</hi> 57.16. his reaſon was, leſt the ſpirit ſhould faile before him: that is, leſt in ſtead of breaking his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to their amendment, hee might breake them to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo they might die vnder the wound: and that were in curing the diſeaſe, to deſtroy nature. In the 125: Pſalme, verſe 3. wee reade, that if his rod in the hand of the wicked, or kept in his owne hand, ſhould ſtill reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lot of the righteous, or neuer ſeaſe to laſh and gaule
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17238:114"/>them, that (then) it would make them deſperate, or full of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; which is meant by the putting forth of their hands to iniquitie: as if they ſhould iudge it all one to be wicked &amp; godlie. Further, Chriſt is ſaid to bee touched with the feeling of our infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. that is, to be one that pittieth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and hath vs in his heart to doe vs good: therefore, hee ſaid to <hi>Saul</hi> when (like a Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liske) with his breath, he ſought to kill all that were of his way, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee? Act.</hi> 9.2.4. The head in heauen, could not abide that his foote on earth, ſhould be troden vpon: and ſo wee ſee, that Chriſt is tender toward his weake Saints, and far from thruſting the weakeſt to the wall:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
                  </note> the reaſons; Reaſon (for our parts) there was none: but ſeeing that God (out of loue) had made Chriſt, (his Sonne) the mediatour, he was to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17238:114"/>be faithfull, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and one part of his faithfulneſſe, was, to binde vp the wounds of his ſicke members: and hence it is that hee ſhed teares for thoſe that ſhed his bloud, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. Secondly, it was put in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that he ſhould heale the broken hearted, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. now, to heale is to cauſe health, not to make ſicke with incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bruiſings. Thirdly, theſe ſweet names giuen him by aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Father; as the name of a Lambe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. of a henne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. of a husband, <hi>Eſa</hi> 54.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.32. of ſhepheard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Heb</hi> 2.11. ſerue to teſtifie how much hee is to vs in the gentleneſſe and naturalneſſe of his loue.</p>
               <p>In the vſe of this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> a Chriſtian with comfort may arme againſt deſpaire in many bruiſings. It is Chriſt, and what cauſe of feare? It is I (ſaith Chriſt to his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17238:115"/>diſciples,) <hi>bee not afraid, Matth.</hi> 14.27. ſo the Angel (ſpeaking to the women that came to the graue) ſaid: <hi>Yee ſeeke Ieſus that was crucified feare not, Matth.</hi> 28.5. therefore, though thou be a reed, and (not whole, but) bruiſed, yet bee of good comfort, come in thy bruiſed reed, to Chriſt, (who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thoſe that are heauie laden, to come to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.) and in ſteade of breaking, hee will heale thee: and (now) is Chriſt ſo mercifull as not to breake vs: let vs not bee ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull to our ſelues, as to breake our ſelues by diſpaire.</p>
               <p>This may be a leſſon to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17238:115"/>One ſaith well, that Satan ſetteth vpon men when they are weake, as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> vpon the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemits, when they were ſore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.25. But Chriſt will not breake this woman, though a bruiſed reed, but puts her in heart, and giues her hope, <hi>Eſa</hi> 42.3. ſo contrarie are Chriſt and Satan. A Miniſter ſhould deſire rather to binde vp a ſicke ſheepe, than to wearie a hundred curres; that is, rather to cure the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſpirit, than to ſpend la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour vpon hardned ſinners: for, indeed the preaching of Chriſt to the bruiſed in heart, is of more conſequence, than the thunderings of iuſtice againſt a hundred Refractaries that care for no rebuke: the latter is to be done; but the former in no caſe to bee omitted.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>S. Marke</hi> bindeth that with a (for or) note of a reaſon, which is not ſo bound in by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> but ſimply ſet downe,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17238:116"/>and without ſuch dependance: for he ſaith onely, that Ieſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid: <hi>It is not meet,</hi> or <hi>good, &amp;c.</hi> both haue one mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and end, which is to ſhew, that it is no meet or honeſt thing that any whelpe of Canaan ſhould preſume to ſit at table with the children of the houſe; and here he giues the dead blow: not onely reiecting her, as one of the heathen without the wall, but as ſprung from the worſt of the nations, the Canaanites: firſt, he anſwered nothing, and (then) from the womans pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, now he ſtrikes at the head, telling her, that he may not doe that, which is neither good, nor comely, nor honeſt: a ſore veny to bee warded, but by a ſtrong faith indeed. &amp; therfore as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> fared with his brethren before hee would open himſelfe vnto them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.15. &amp; 45.1, 2, 3.16.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo doth the true <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> that was ſold into the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17238:116"/>hands of ſinners, deale with a pitifull plaintife here: for, hee ſpeakes roughly to her, and in the whirlewind; or ſo as ſhee might ſeeme to bee much worſe after ſhee had prayed vnto him with a lamentable crie than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet the laſt makes the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all: Chriſt tells her who he is (as did <hi>Ioſeph</hi>) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens himſelfe to her ſingular conſolation. And ſo we ſee,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct:</hi> 2</note> that God doth (ſometimes) anſwer roughly, where hee meanes not to denie; thus God held <hi>Dauid</hi> to hard meate, not anſwering as hee expected, but ſo as in his owne ſence, hee ſeemed, and feared as one vtterly caſt off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. but was not, <hi>v.</hi> 10.11. he ſaith will the Lord caſt off for euer? <hi>v.</hi> 7. long hee had beene off, and therefore hee ſo ſpeaketh: yet <hi>v.</hi> 10. hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſleth his infirmitie, or want of faith in ſo ſaying: and here God quickened his hope, and let him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17238:117"/>ſee where hee was: his long night made him to thinke it would neuer be day: but though great darkneſſe was vpon him, yet he remembred the perpetuall couenant of day and night to Gods ſeruants; and when hee looked vp, he ſaw it. In another Pſalme, the people after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne our of captiuitie, prayed mightilie to God vnder his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie diſpleaſure, which vexed them long: and therefore they ſay, <hi>wilt thou be angry with vs for euer, Pſal.</hi> 85.5. ſo great was his anger, and ſo terrible in effects, that they thought it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be better: yet theſe were the people of his loue and neere ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, againſt whom he ſo fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for ſo long, <hi>v.</hi> 9.10. and they were his people (whoſe prayers he heard) againſt whoſe prayers he was ſaid to be angry, or to ſmoke againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. the like we reade in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.46. the words are, <hi>Lord how long wilt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17238:117"/>thou hide thy ſelf?</hi> what for euer? it was long ere hee would be ſeene in his comfortable preſence, and in the face of his throne towards them: neuertheleſſe, at laſt, hee was viſible in his clemencie and goodneſſe to thoſe from whom hee had hid himſelfe ſo long, as if quite gone from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> houſe in the ruines of the ſtate then: ſtill (then) wee ſee that God anſwereth roughly at the doore, when his ſeruants knocke to come in. God deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued <hi>Daniel,</hi> and hee made many prayers for the peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in the captiuitie: yet was he put off, and they not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till the iuſt time came, in which hee had appointed their deliuerance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.22.23, 24, 25, 26. meane while, they were in ſubiection (ſtill) to all affronts, and indignities of a barbarous nation; and thus for a while, Chriſt dealeth with his brethren as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> with his brothers, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17238:118"/>with <hi>Beniamin,</hi> his full brother; for, how rowndly did hee deale with them, and how ſharply with him? in like manner doth Chriſt with his;

Secondly, there may bee hypocriſie in our beſt prayers which is not ſo ſoone perceiued and repented of, if they ſhould be heard at firſt, and before they haue ſtood (ſometime) vpon our hands; &amp; it is in this, as in the graine that wee carry into our barnes; it muſt haue a wintering, the ſnow muſt lie vpon it, and the nipping froſt pinch it: ſo if the Lord ſhall gather any fruits of his children,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17238:118"/>they muſt ſometimes feele the hard weather of repulſes, and ſometimes bee turned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with denials, when they put vp their requeſts to God.

               <p>THe woman anſwers Chriſt (here) with retorting his owne argument vpon him.

This might be the womans humble reply to

Some would haue ſaid otherwayes (being ſo cut to the gall) and haue had an action againſt him for calling them dogges. But ſhee iuſtifies Chriſt in what he had ſaid; and impliedly rather, confeſſeth her ſelfe to bee a dogge, then can thinke that he could ſpeake falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who called, or compared, her ſo.

The more we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our ſelues in this glaſſe, the more patient we will bee in the hardeſt things that come.

Till God had opened his eyes, by ſhewing vnto him his ſinne, and by making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, as the light at noon-day, now impoſſible it was for a God, ſo innocent, to puniſh without cauſe; he ſtood ſtiffely vpon his iuſtification, and thought hee could ſet downe God with his

So, if we would rightly conſider our wayes, and our ſelues in ſinne, inſtead of reaſoning with God about our troubles, wee would confeſſe his iuſt hand vpon vs, and ſay to our ſelues as the euill doer to his fellow, we are iuſtly here. Luk. 23.41. but we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the puniſhment, and weigh not the ſinnes that haue cauſed it, and therefore that God ſtrikes too hard for ſmall matters.

To bee ſhort, how many more faithfull then this woman, and how many more humble? Therefore the denials of Chriſt were but as ſo many ſtrong windes, to cauſe the flame of her faith to riſe vp higher.</p>
                  <p>But here further, the woman ſpeaking of ſome crummes or fallings from the table of the children, intimates that it was a full table, a table that ranne ouer, and where was no want, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings rather. And (here)
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17238:141"/>learne that the Iewes diet (in time of the Law) was no ſpare diet,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2</note> but a table running ouer to the Gentiles. <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.27. the widow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.26. the woman of Samaria, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.28. the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Saint <hi>Matthew, Matth.</hi> 8.5.6.7.8. <hi>Iob</hi> in <hi>Vz, Iob</hi> 1.1. and this woman here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were all fed, though not with the whole loafe, yet with crummes from the childrens table.

Though (God) then but dropped vpon them, yet (in the Goſpell, and when the Iewes would not come to the Kings wedding dinner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.9, 10.) they had a plentifull raine of grace, which was ſhed vpon them abundantly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. and then the hall was ſet round with gueſts.

                     </note> It is for his greater glory: for, that houſe-keeping is much commended where is no want. But God ſpares for no coſt, where his gueſts come willingly: if they want not a ſtomacke, they ſhall want for no meat; for hee that is rich in abundance of all heaneuly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, will ſerue them of all that their heart can deſire. <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> feaſt, that which hee made to his Princes, was much ſpoken of, <hi>Heſt</hi> 1.3, 4.5. and will the Lord of glory doe leſſe in that ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, which he prouideth for his peoples ſaluation, then a mortall ſinfull man did in that which was made for his magnificence? Secondly, God dearely loues his children, and they ſhall haue of the beſt. Where men loue deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will prouide for them as they are able, and wiſh they had better. But this wiſh needs not, where hee makes the feaſt, who is rich in grace: and, neither loth
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17238:142"/>to goe the charge where hee loues, as miſerable; nor in any want of abilitie to doe it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient: for hee hath will and abilitie both. Thirdly, it is the wedding dinner of the Kings Sonne, <hi>Matth:</hi> 22.2. and doe Kings make a ſpare dinner when they marie the Prince, their eldeſt Sonne? Hence wee reade of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. and ſo not of a ſcant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him, but of a meaſure running ouer: his grace is not by droppes, but by ſhowers.</p>

She had receiued three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes: and if ſhee had receiued (not three, but) threſcore more: with ſuch a faith ſhee could not haue gone away confounded. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Some, with their dimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiues,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17238:144"/>would make her faith leſſe than Chriſt hath ſaid, and the matter of it not ſo great; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that her requeſt was no more but that Chriſt would heale her daughter ſicke of a deuill in her: and what is that to ſaluation? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſſe there is no more expreſſed in the text: yet this anſwer of Chriſt, and the womans carriage in her former ſore flight, ſhew that more was at the ſtake, and that the health of her daughter was not all the matter: the ſaluation of her and her daughter was chiefely ſought; and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters health, as Chriſts pawne for it; who (therefore) ſaith: be it vnto thee as thou wilt; or that, and much more than that. In ſo ample a grant, then, how can it be but that more was meant than her daughters well being in the bodie, as the forgiuenes of ſinnes to both, and to both, faith in Chriſt, to ſaluation? Further,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17238:145"/>Chriſt doth not ſay, Woman but with a ſacred exclamation, O woman, as pained till he was deliuered of ſo much: his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions boiled as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> did, till hee had opened himſelfe: and now he melteth ouer her, as he ouer his brethren, when he had told them who he was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.1, 2, 3. nor doth he onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her great faith, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, as before at the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith, O woman, as if he had ſaid: O noble daughter of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> noble in ſo great a faith: I muſt now tell thee that I am that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that God hath ſent, in this ſpirituall long famine of Canaan, to thee, and to thy daughter: ſhortly <hi>Iacob</hi> will bee in Aegypt, and the houre of the Gentiles is neere, but yours is come already: and now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is gone out of thy daughter: thou haſt had power with God: thou ſhalt haue power againſt

Thirdly, the deuill (who is the accuſer of the brethren, and a ſlanderer,) doth belie the goodneſſe of the Saints, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.11. and ſhall Chriſtians, that ſhould follow Chriſt, bee like the deuill? Fourthly, we ſhould incourage the good in

Papiſts were wont to be alone in ſuch wrong done to true Chriſtians; but company comes vnto them, euen out of our owne profeſſion; and this leproſie of a foule tongue is gone from <hi>Naaman</hi> to <hi>Gehazi,</hi> from them to ſome Proteſtants,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> teaching vs to loue good men for the good things in them: for ſo we will loue ſuch much better in whom they be. We loue gold, though in the filthy oare; and will take vp a iewell, though trodden in the mire: ſo if we lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued goodneſſe for it ſelfe (that is, truly loued it) we would not neglect it, though in the foile of a bad man, or trodden in the mire of a heart very ſinfull: much leſſe would we diſ-regard it pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a worthy ſubiect Parents loue their children with a ſtrong loue: the reaſon is, they haue that in them which they loue; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So Chriſtians ſhould follow true Chriſtians with like force of true loue; the reaſon is, they haue that in them which they ſhould loue; grace. This loue of parents to their children, makes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17238:147"/>that they care not how much good they ſpeake, or heare ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, ſo if like loue, or any were in vs towards theſe earthly Saints, we would ſpeake our ſelues, and be glad to heare others ſpeake much good of them, for the grace of God in them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3</note> this is for admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſtians to beware of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy in regard of graces, which are in others, more then in themſelues. For, ſuch will bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from that wormwood of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, (inſtead of praiſing) oppoſe againſt them. So did <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and therefore roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their better brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.4.18, 19. And <hi>Cain</hi> ſet his crueltie on worke againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> a farre better man then himſelfe, and his owne naturall brother: where nothing could eaſe the great paine of his enuie, but a medicine made of his brothers bloud. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4 8. So the Phariſees
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17238:148"/>and Prieſts among the Iewes, watched Chriſt in the graue that he ſhould not riſe: <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.66. and ſo the enuious among vs (louers of themſelues, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.) put vertue in the graue with Chriſt, and watch it that it riſe not. But further, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt not wrong others in their good parts by enuious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions; ſo, neither (hauing ſuch good parts in them) muſt they wrong themſelues by falſe teſtimonie: I ſay, falſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: for there is falſe witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a mans ſelfe, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his neighbour. Many well indewed of God, in ſome fits of the ſpirituall feauer, fare as if they had nothing; no faith, no hope, no grace. And ſome, in the affliction, ſay (though before they had done exceeding well) that they were neuer good before God, nor ſound in profeſſion, but hypocrites. So the deuill would haue it. But ſhould Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17238:148"/>ioyne iſſue with Sathan againſt themſelues? Is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſtrong enough without our helpe; and except we wrong our ſelues to gratifie him? rather, we ſhould fight vnder God againſt him, then with him, againſt our owne ſoule. For ſo did righteous <hi>Iob,</hi> in the thickeſt miſt of his troubles: His friends had vrged him hard, and would baue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him, that though he had done many good things, yet it was in no ſoundneſſe to God. But <hi>Iob</hi> (though hee had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes loſt all; his children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, ſubſtance, and all) yet he would not be ſo great a loſer to them and the deuill, as to part with his integritie in what hee had done. <hi>Iob</hi> 27.5. for where he had failed, he knew hee had made vp the reckoning by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſorrow for ſinne. and (therefore) doubted not, but that ſo much was left as would comfort him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17238:149"/>them.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour purpoſing to commend this womans vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried petitioning to him in regard of her daughter and her ſelfe, commends that which was the roote of that fruit, her great faith. Which faith is a grace of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby we beleeue for our ſelues, and particularly, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. And to this faith of hers, the health of her daughter is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, as the branch to the root that beares it. Where wee ſee,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2</note> that by faith we haue acceptance with God; the good workes we doe, being as fruites of that tree. Hence <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking of a iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſinner, ſaith, that the booke is cleared by forgiuing the debt, and not by any ſatisfaction made, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.2. This faith beleeues, and workes haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in her office. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, To him that worketh not, but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him that iuſtifieth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,

Rom.</hi> 4.5 that is, all the ſatisfaction that a iuſtified ſinner can make, is to beleeue, that it is made without him, or any thing that he can do. And ſo faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth by imputation: what it gets in the account, it gets it by Chriſt that hath paied the whole debt of ſinne, and turneth ouer his obedience to thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey but imperfectly and vnprofitably, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. and ſo haue no righteouſneſſe but what is his: <hi>Rom</hi> 5.22.

Therefore in his Epiſtles to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17238:150"/>the Romanes, to the Galathians, and Epheſians, hee ſtrongly pleades the cauſe of faith in the power of iuſtification without workes: plainly, in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, verſ. 8. and 9. he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the beſt things, left in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the beſt workes in new nature from the merit of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, <hi>We are ſaued by grace:</hi> not of our ſelues, againſt <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and not of workes, againſt Papiſts: and giues the reaſon, which is to preuent all boaſting in our ſelues; as if wee did, (as Papiſts ſay we doe) bring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in hand to the purchaſe of our ſaluation. And ſo we ſee that faith maketh our way to God, and that works follow.

               <p>This is againſt the Papiſts,

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1</note> who (like dogges) barke againſt the truth of ſole iuſtification by faith. Their tenet is, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe whereby we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is inherent in vs. But the righteouſneſſe, that doth iuſtifie, is called a robe: and why a robe, but becauſe wee haue it (as wee haue our clothes) from another, out of our ſelues? Fleſh and skin we haue from our mothers, but our apparell is made vs. So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we haue by birth, but grace by gift in the hand of faith. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to be found in Chriſt, <hi>Philip</hi> 3.9. clad with him. <hi>Obiect.</hi> True, ſay the Papiſts, all wee haue in our firſt iuſtification or change to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17238:151"/>righteouſneſſe, wee haue from God onely, and all is due to him for it. But (ſay they) there is a ſecond iuſtification or change, and that as a ſtocke giuen vs to ſet vp for themſelues, as it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnder our hand, maketh ſome part of pay to our ſaluation. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But if the Apoſtle (as we heard) had knowne any iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication but one, and that one onely and altogether by gift, hee would not haue giuen away his owne part, as hee did, and haue acknowledged no other iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but that of beeing in Chriſt. And further, the Apoſtle giues the reaſon why hee did ſo, though in another place. For, ſpeaking of God that iuſtifieth and ſaueth onely, hee ſaith, <hi>For</hi> (and that <hi>for</hi> muſt ſtand) <hi>For,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of him, and through him, are all things.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17238:152"/>all are of and from God. And now where wee ſpeake of faith, we vnderſtand not ſuch a faith, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> reproueth, which is a faith without workes, and ſo dead, as the bodie is dead that breatheth not, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.26. but a ſaith accompanied with or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in manifeſt ſymptomes of new life: ſuch a faith this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had which in her was ſo commended.

A fearfull darknes (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) muſt needes bee vpon all that want this Sunne of their holy faith. And let them thinke of it, who (as one ſaith well) haue paſſed an eſtate of their ſoules to ignorance for tearme of life: neither haue they heard, nor will they.

They deſerue not good things that will not open their mouthes for them: and we haue a ſaying, Spare to ſpeake,

Faith (then) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good things the beſt, how vnworthy ſhall wee ſhew our ſelues of ſo faire a Iewell, if wee will not aske it? Thirdly, as we get faith by the Word and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo (being had) we muſt keep it in a good conſcience. For faith and good conſcience are <hi>relata,</hi> one cannot be without the other. Hee that puts away good conſcience in his life, puts away faith: they come together, and go together, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 19. &amp; 3.9. <hi>Paul</hi> might earneſtly (as with the hold of faith) behold the counſell, who had liued in all good conſcience, from the day of his conuerſion, to that day. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. But with what face of faith can they appeare before God or man, who (hitherto) haue had no cleare conſcience toward either? <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. And who (therefore) being men of no conſcience, are men of no faith.</p>
